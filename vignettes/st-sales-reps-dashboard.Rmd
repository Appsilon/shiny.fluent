This is Part 2 of shiny.fluent tutorial. In [Part 1]() we built an app that lets us filter sales transactions data, and view the results on a plot and a map and in a table. It has nice features, but is not looking that good. Let's now build a dashboard UI for that app, with top command bar and a sidebar with navigation.
