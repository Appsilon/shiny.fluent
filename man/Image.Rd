\description{
An image is a graphic representation of something (e.g photo or illustration). The borders have been added to these examples in order to help visualize empty space in the image frame.

For more details and examples visit the official \href{https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/Image}{docs}.
The R package can not handle each and every case, so for advanced use cases
you need to work using the original docs to achieve the desired result.
